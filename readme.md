## **Detailed Explanation**

### **1. `POST /api/borrowers`**
- **Purpose**: Registers a new borrower in the library system.  
- **Input**: A **JSON request body** containing borrower details: `name` and `email`.  
- **Output**: Returns the registered borrowerâ€™s information, including a unique `borrowerId`.  
- **Validation**: Ensures that `name` and `email` are valid and not empty.  
- **Use Case**: Adds a new user (borrower) to the system who can borrow books.  

---

### **2. `POST /api/books`**
- **Purpose**: Registers a new book in the library system.  
- **Input**: A **JSON request body** containing book details: `isbn`, `title`, and `author`.  
- **Output**: Returns the registered bookâ€™s information, including a unique `bookId`.  
- **Validation**: Ensures no conflicts occur with an existing book's ISBN, title, or author.  
- **Use Case**: Adds a new book to the library catalog.  

---

### **3. `GET /api/books`**
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a **paginated list of books** in the library.  
- **Input**: Query Parameters:  
   - `page` (default = 0): Page number (zero-based).  
   - `size` (default = 10): Number of books per page.  
- **Output**: Returns a paginated list of books with their details:  
  - `bookId`, `isbn`, `title`, `author`, and `borrowerId` (if applicable).  
- **Use Case**: Provides users or administrators with an overview of books in the library, using pagination for scalability.  

---

### **4. `GET /api/books/all`**
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a **complete list of all books** without pagination.  
- **Input**: No input required.  
- **Output**: Returns a list of books with their details:  
  - `bookId`, `isbn`, `title`, `author`, and `borrowerId` (if applicable).  
- **Use Case**: Useful for scenarios where all books need to be retrieved at once (e.g., exporting data, admin dashboards).  

---

### **5. `PUT /api/books/{bookId}/borrow/{borrowerId}`**
- **Purpose**: Allows a borrower to **borrow a specific book**.  
- **Input**:  
   - `bookId`: Path parameter identifying the book to borrow.  
   - `borrowerId`: Path parameter identifying the borrower.  
- **Output**: Returns the updated book details with the `borrowerId` set to the borrower.  
- **Validation**: Ensures the book is not already borrowed.  
- **Use Case**: Marks a book as borrowed by a specific borrower.

---

### **6. `PUT /api/books/{bookId}/return`**
- **Purpose**: Allows a borrower to **return a borrowed book**.  
- **Input**:  
   - `bookId`: Path parameter identifying the book being returned.  
- **Output**: Returns the updated book details with `borrowerId` set to `null`, indicating the book is now available.  
- **Validation**: Ensures the book is currently marked as borrowed.  
- **Use Case**: Marks a book as returned and available for other borrowers.

## **Setup**
Hereâ€™s the refined **Run Locally** section based on your requirement:  

- **Maven**: Use this for **development**, code modification, or testing the application.  
- **Docker Compose**: Use this to quickly run the **finished product** in a simple and consistent environment.  

---

### **Run Locally**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ariefwara/cloud-libra.git
   cd cloud-libra
   ```

2. **Database Setup**  
   - Install PostgreSQL on your host machine.  
   - Create a database and apply the schema:
     ```bash
     psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f src/main/resources/schema.sql
     ```

---

#### **Option 1: For Development (Maven)**

Use this option if you need to **develop**, **test**, or make code modifications:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally.  

2. Run the application using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the application:  
   - **API Base URL**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
   - **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

---

#### **Option 2: For Simple Environment (Docker Compose)**  

Use this option to quickly run the **finished product** in a controlled environment:

1. Navigate to the `deploy/local` folder:
   ```bash
   cd deploy/local
   ```

2. Run the application with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application:  
   - **API Base URL**: [http://localhost:8402](http://localhost:8402)

- **Run Unit Tests**:  
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

- **Generate Code Coverage Report**:  
   ```bash
   mvn verify
   ```  
   The JaCoCo report will be available under `target/site/jacoco`.

## **Assumptions**

1. Books with the **same ISBN** must have the same `title` and `author`.  
2. Multiple copies of the same book (same ISBN) can exist but with different unique IDs.  
3. A book can only be borrowed by **one borrower** at a time.
